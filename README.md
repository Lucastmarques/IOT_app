# IOT_app
A flutter app that commands my ESP8266, therefore, my ESP8266 can control my A/C and my lamp. Plus, I can check the Temperature and Humidity in my bedroom.

This is just a Alpha version of the app, to the future I intend to implement new functions to make me free to add or remove a internet controlled services. Maybe include google or amazon personal assistants.
